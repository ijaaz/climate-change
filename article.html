<p>Global warming is a clear &amp; present danger to all life on earth. Global warming
is destroying biospheres as we speak. For some species - including polar bears
- extinction is imminent. The human race is the most significant contributor to
global warming.</p>

<h3 id="globalwarmingisinevitable">Global Warming is inevitable</h3>

<p>We have missed our largest chance to do anything about it. This is due to our
inaction, doubts, and shortsightedness. Some people also have an advantage in
the new century of global warming, this induces them to procrastinate and take
a shortsighted approach to global warming.</p>

<h3 id="wearespeedingitup">We are speeding it up</h3>

<p>We have steadily increased global warming through greenhouse gasses
&amp; deforestation. We are creating a world where the atmosphere will be dangerous
for all life.</p>

<h3 id="thereareconsequences">There are consequences</h3>

<p>Human beings are naturally shortsighted, we naturally procrastinate, and this
is because we live such short lives.</p>

<p>while these lives are short, they are also full of value and meaning, but we
 may not value the environment as much as we should because our value system
 has less to do with the environment, and more to do with technology that
 let&#8217;s us escape the environment, especially nowadays were, when it&#8217;s cold, we
 turn on the heat, and when it&#8217;s hot, we turn on the air conditioner. </p>

<p>This all lead&#8217;s to a shortsightededness when we think about the future, the
problem is that this will kill us, especially when we are talking about the
environment.</p>

<h3 id="thescienceofglobalwarming">the science of global warming</h3>

<h4 id="greenhousegasses">Greenhouse gasses</h4>

<p>Global Warming is the rise of average temperature around the globe. Global
warming is mainly caused by our increased reliance on Greenhouse gases in the
last couple decades.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases are gases that trap solar radiation.</p>

<p>These are the most 6 abundant Greenhouse gases (in order):</p>

<ol>
<li>Water Vapor</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide</li>
<li>Methane</li>
<li>Nitrous oxide</li>
<li>Ozone</li>
<li>CFCs</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the Industrial Revolution<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> we have rapidly increased our use and
dependence on fossil fuels. Fussil fuels emit large amounts of carbon dioxide,
this creates more Greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>The Greenhouse effect is the idea that the suns rays are hitting the earth,
then bouncing off. Now you&#8217;d think that the bouncing rays would go right up and
away, but instead, Greenhouse gases are partially trapping the heat in.</p>

<p>The problem is that we are making to much Greenhouse gases, so much that a lot
more of the heat is staying in. The consequences are scary, imagine us one day
boiling alive.</p>
