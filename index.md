# Climate Change

warning! This is a work in progress

## Introduction

### Say something interesting/contentious

Global warming is a clear & present danger to all life on earth. Global warming
is destroying biospheres as we speak. For some species - including polar bears
- extinction is imminent. The human race is the most significant contributor to
global warming.

### Global Warming is inevitable

We have missed our largest chance to do anything about it. This is due to our
inaction, doubts, and shortsightedness. Some people also have an advantage in
the new century of global warming, this induces them to procrastinate and take
a shortsighted approach to global warming.

### We are speeding it up

We have steadily increased global warming through greenhouse gasses
& deforestation. We are creating a world where the atmosphere will be dangerous
for all life.

### There are consequences

Human beings are naturally shortsighted, we naturally procrastinate, and this
is because we live such short lives.

while these lives are short, they are also full of value and meaning, but we
  may not value the environment as much as we should because our value system
  has less to do with the environment, and more to do with technology that
  let's us escape the environment, especially nowadays were, when it's cold, we
  turn on the heat, and when it's hot, we turn on the air conditioner. 

This all lead's to a shortsightededness when we think about the future, the
problem is that this will kill us, especially when we are talking about the
environment.

## Main Idea 1 "What is global warming"

### the science of global warming
#### Greenhouse gasses

Global Warming is the rise of average temperature around the globe.  Global
warming is mainly caused by our increased reliance on Greenhouse gases in the
last couple decades.

The Greenhouse effect is a system
of energy flows ![alt Greenhouse

influx and emittance are expressed in watts per square meter (W/m2).'")

#### Deforestation


                  

#### Different global climate change models

## Main Idea 2 "The dangers of global warming"

### Weird climate effects
#### Floods
#### Sinkholes
#### Intense heat waves
#### The economic effect
#### Famine

### The danger to the developing world
#### Less wealth, less cushion

### The dangers of global warming disbelief or/and inaction
### How vocal minorities danger us all
### Heats effect on decision making and crime.

### Biodiversity
#### Deforestation
#### Heat

### Long term dangers
#### Including permanent biosphere change, making earth uninhabitable to humans
#### Death of most animals

## Main Idea 3 "The Consequences of global warming, perhaps?"

### Famine
#### Due to decreased world food production

### Death from heat
#### Heat increase

### Water
#### Heat evaporation
#### Over-use

## Main Idea 4 "What we can do to slow down global warming"

### Clean energy use
### Eat less meat 75%
### Recycle
### Energy efficient light bulbs
### Less fracking

### Long term
#### Artificial Biosphere
#### Migration to another planet
#### Artificial genetic mutation
#### Genocide
#### Terraforming

## Conclusion

### Global warming is a danger to all
### There are consequences to global warming
### WE can all do something to try and fix it

### Good ending sentence; maybe
#### Death is inevitable, but we choose how we die
#### We choose what we 

- Climate Change: Sources
  - http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/22/global-warming-hit-asia-hardest
      "Theses of this article is that global warming will hit everyone, but
      asia the hardest."

- Supporting evidence
    - UN article
      - This source was relevant to them due to it's warnings of asia's specific vulnerabilities including heat stress, extreme precipitation, drought, and water scarcity.
      - Another reason this source was relevant is due to it's warnings of general global climate change risks including greater likelihood of injury, under-nutrition, and more deaths due to fires & heatwaves
      - Other potential risks include food shortages of 12% or more

- http://blog.ucsusa.org/ocean-cooling-effect-global-warming-459
  "This article believes that the ocean is a temporary "speed bump", or air conditioner, slowing down global warming."
  - Supporting evidence
   - This article uses http://www.wunderground.com/news/no-hiatus-pause-global-warming-climate-change-heres-why-20140109 and https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-hiatus-tied-cooler-temps-pacific to support colder than general water temeratures
  - Relevance
   - This article is refutes the common theme that global warming is not happening, but instead that the ocean's uncommon "cold" (specifically the pacific) is acting as a buffer, or temporary temperature relief.
- http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/01/exxon-mobil-climate-change-fossil-fuels-oil
  - Supporting evidence
   - This article uses an exxon report on global climate change, and also uses the ipcc annual report on global climate change.
